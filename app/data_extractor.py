                For documents containing structured box-type information, extract only the specified fields as follows:

                1. **Field Extraction**:
                   - **International Application No.**:
                     - Locate the field labeled **"International Application No."** in the **first image of the document**.
                     - Extract the number that starts with **"PCT/"** and ensure the full number is included in the output.

                   - **Box No. II (Email)**:
                     - Identify **Box No. II**, and extract the email located under the **"Email Authorization"** subsection.
                     - Stop extracting once the next **Box No.** heading appears.

                   - **Box No. IV (Email)**:
                     - Locate the email under the **"Email Authorization"** subsection in **Box No. IV**.
                     - Capture the email text between **Box No. IV** and the subsequent **Box No.** heading.

                   - **Box No. X (Name and Signature)**:
                     - Identify **Box No. X**, and extract all relevant textual details (e.g., names or signatures).
                     - Specifically, locate and capture text enclosed within **forward slashes (`/ /`)**, ensuring the extracted content corresponds to a name or signature.
                     - Stop extracting at the next **Box No.** heading.

                2. **Output**:
                   - Return the extracted data only if the field is present in the document. If a field is missing, omit it from the output without generating placeholders or assumptions.

                3. **Format**:
                   - Output the extracted fields in the following format:
                     ```
                     International Application No.: [Extracted Application Number]
                     Email from Box No. II: [Extracted Email]
                     Email from Box No. IV: [Extracted Email]
                     Name from Box No. X: [Extracted Name or Signature]
                     Name of Signatory from Box No. X: [Extracted Name of Signatory]
                     ```

                4. **Guidelines**:
                   - Remove extraneous characters or text unrelated to the specified fields.
                   - Avoid creating or inferring content for fields that are not present in the document.
                   - If a specific **Box No.** or its content is not detected, leave it out of the final output.

                5. **Assumptions**:
                   - Extraction will strictly adhere to the fields mentioned above and their descriptions.
                   - Do not include additional comments, notes, or inferred information in the output.

                Focus on accurately extracting the specified information from each **Box No.** without deviation or inference beyond the described criteria.
